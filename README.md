# AlgorithmPrograms

## Overview
Welcome to my algorithm collection! This repository showcases a variety of algorithms implemented in C++. The aim is to demonstrate different problem-solving techniques and enhance coding skills. This collection includes essential algorithms like Binary Search, Quick Search, Quick Sort, and finding the Median of Two Merged Arrays.

## Contents
- [Binary Search](./binarySearch.cpp)
- [Quick Search](./quickSearch.cpp)
- [Quick Sort](./quickSort.cpp)
- [Median of Two Merged Arrays](./medianTwoArrays.cpp)

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to serve as a resource for those interested in learning and applying fundamental algorithms. It can be used for academic purposes, interview preparation, or personal projects. Each program is designed to be clear and understandable, with comments explaining key parts of the code.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nowtestify24/algorithm-programs.git

2. Change the directory:
    cd algorithm-programs
   
3.Compile and run program
 g++ -std=c++11 -o binarySearch binarySearch.cpp
./binarySearch
